## Core Algorithms and Code Examples

### 1. Real-Time Traffic Optimization
ChronoSynapse can be used for real-time traffic prediction and optimization. Here's an example of a simple traffic simulation:

```python
import random
import time

class ChronoSynapseTraffic:
    def __init__(self, max_capacity=100, initial_traffic=50):
        self.max_capacity = max_capacity
        self.current_traffic = initial_traffic

    def predict_traffic(self):
        """Simulate real-time traffic prediction."""
        return random.randint(0, self.max_capacity)

    def adapt_traffic_lights(self, traffic_data):
        """Adapt traffic lights based on real-time traffic data."""
        if traffic_data > 80:
            return "Increase red light duration"
        elif traffic_data > 60:
            return "Increase green light duration"
        else:
            return "Normal light cycle"

    def run_simulation(self):
        """Run a simple simulation of real-time traffic optimization."""
        while True:
            traffic_data = self.predict_traffic()
            action = self.adapt_traffic_lights(traffic_data)
            print(f"Predicted Traffic: {traffic_data}% | Action: {action}")
            time.sleep(2)

# Initialize and start simulation
chrono_synapse = ChronoSynapseTraffic()
chrono_synapse.run_simulation()
```

### 2. Quantum-Classical Hybrid Model
Example of a quantum-classical hybrid model:

```python
from qiskit import Aer, QuantumCircuit, execute
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import layers

# Quantum circuit for prediction (simple quantum function for data encoding)
def quantum_predictor(data):
    qc = QuantumCircuit(1, 1)
    qc.h(0)  # Apply Hadamard gate for superposition
    qc.measure(0, 0)

    # Run the quantum circuit on a simulator
    simulator = Aer.get_backend('qasm_simulator')
    result = execute(qc, simulator).result()
    counts = result.get_counts()

    # Simplified quantum result processing
    if '1' in counts:
        return np.random.normal(data, 0.1)  # Perturb the data for classical model input
    else:
        return data

# Classical Neural Network for refined predictions
def classical_nn_predict(data):
    model = tf.keras.Sequential([
        layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(1,)),
        layers.Dense(1)
    ])
    model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
    return model.predict(np.array([[data]]))

# Example of hybrid model (quantum + classical)
def hybrid_model(data):
    # Step 1: Process data through quantum circuit
    quantum_output = quantum_predictor(data)

    # Step 2: Refine prediction using classical neural network
    prediction = classical_nn_predict(quantum_output)
    return prediction

# Test the hybrid system
data_point = 0.5  # Example input data
print(f"Predicted Value: {hybrid_model(data_point)}")
```

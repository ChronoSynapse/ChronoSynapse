# ChronoSynapse Architecture Overview

## System Overview

ChronoSynapse is designed to simulate, predict, and optimize dynamic systems through a multi-layered architecture involving quantum-classical hybrid models, real-time data processing, and autonomous adaptation.

### Key Layers

1. **Quantum Neural Processor (QNP)**:
   - Processes large volumes of high-dimensional data using quantum circuits.
   - Provides superior pattern recognition for complex systems.
  
2. **Temporal Awareness Layer (TAL)**:
   - Incorporates time perception to forecast future system states and optimize decisions.
   - Uses neural networks for temporal data prediction.

3. **Adaptive Neural Network (ANN)**:
   - Continuously learns from environmental feedback to enhance decision-making and predictions.
   - Adaptation is crucial for real-time adjustments in autonomous systems.

4. **Data Ingestion**:
   - Collects data from IoT sensors, external APIs, and other sources.
   - Preprocesses raw data into usable formats for the AI models.

### Distributed Architecture

ChronoSynapse operates over a decentralized network of AI nodes, ensuring scalability, resilience, and data privacy. Each node processes local data and shares insights with the system for collective optimization.

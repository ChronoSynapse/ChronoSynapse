# ChronoSynapse User Guide

## Overview

ChronoSynapse is an advanced AI system designed for autonomous decision-making and optimization. This guide provides an introduction to setting up and using the system across various applications.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ChronoSynapse.git
    cd ChronoSynapse
    ```
2. Install the dependencies from `requirements.txt`:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Import and use the main modules as needed. For example, to work with the Quantum Neural Processor:

    ```python
    from src.quantum_neural_processor import QuantumNeuralProcessor
    ```

## Key Components

- **Quantum Neural Processor (QNP)**: Executes quantum circuits to process high-dimensional data.
- **Temporal Awareness Layer (TAL)**: Helps forecast future events using historical data.
- **Adaptive Neural Network (ANN)**: Continuously learns from new data to improve predictions.

## Example Use Case

### Real-Time Traffic Optimization:
ChronoSynapse can optimize traffic flow in a smart city by processing real-time sensor data, adjusting traffic signals, and rerouting vehicles based on predicted traffic patterns.

```python
from src.data_ingestion import ingest_traffic_data
from src.temporal_awareness_layer import TemporalAwarenessLayer

data = ingest_traffic_data()
tal = TemporalAwarenessLayer()
tal.train(data)
predictions = tal.predict(data)

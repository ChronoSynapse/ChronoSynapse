# ChronoSynapse - Deployment Notes

## System Requirements
- **Operating System**: Linux (Ubuntu 20.04 or later recommended)
- **RAM**: Minimum 16GB
- **GPU**: Optional, for neural network acceleration (NVIDIA GTX 1080 or better)
- **Dependencies**:
  - Python 3.9+
  - TensorFlow / PyTorch
  - Qiskit for Quantum Computing
  - NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib

## Deployment Steps
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ChronoSynapse/ChronoSynapse.git
    cd ChronoSynapse
    ```
2. Install required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. Configure the system:
    - Update `sample_config.json` with your system parameters.
    - Place your IoT data in the `data/` directory.
4. Run the simulation:
    ```bash
    python src/main.py
    ```

## Known Issues
- **Quantum Neural Processor**: Currently experiencing minor coherence issues under heavy load. This will be addressed in the next release.
- **Real-Time Adaptation**: Latency may vary based on the scale of data ingestion.

## Future Work
- Integration with more IoT devices for wider deployment.
- Improved predictive models for stock market and autonomous vehicle simulations.
